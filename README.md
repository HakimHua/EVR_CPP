The repository is the location for the binary executable of the C++ version of EVR.

We don't provide C++ source code for EVR programs , but you can download the binary programs for Linux and Windows systems from the release page.

Before using this tool, you need to copy the 'CORE.cl' file in the repository to the directory where the executable is located.
